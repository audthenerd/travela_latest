## :paperclip: What is Travela?
Travela started off as a class project and the objective was to facilitate travellers who'd like to have a more organised itinerary.
This application uses <b>React on Rails</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>Google Maps</b> and <b>Foursquare</b> APIs.
<b>React</b> handles the APIs request and <b>Rails</b> handles the itineraries database.
